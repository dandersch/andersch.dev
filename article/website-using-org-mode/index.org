* Publishing
Both the ~.org~ and ~.html~ files are part of the same repository. This means that
the directory structure is identical and all links to images, files, etc. are
the same for both formats. Org-publish takes care of mapping every link to an
~.org~ to the corresponding ~.html~, but if I want to, I can still link to the
actual org-mode file, since it is part of the GitHub Pages repo. For example,
[[http:./index.org][here]] you can find the original source for the page you are on right now. In
fact, you can get the ~.org~ of every page by appending ~index.org~ to the current
link or changing ~.html~ to ~.org~.
