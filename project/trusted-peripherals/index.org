As part of my bachelor's thesis, I researched the prospect of isolating
peripherals in embedded devices to a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), which
in theory should make them an equally trusted part of the system. This would
enable us to, e.g., have confidence in the integrity of a sensor's readings,
even if the device attached to the sensor is located in an untrusted
environment.

For the hardware I used the Cortex-M33-based /NUCLEO-L5552ZE-Q/ development board
and for the RTOS I used [[https://www.zephyrproject.org/][Zephyr]] in combination with a customized version of
[[https://www.trustedfirmware.org/projects/tf-m/][TrustedFirmware-M]], which provides a standard-compliant TEE implementation.

You can find the source code [[https://github.com/dandersch/trusted-peripherals][here]] and the thesis as a pdf [[./thesis.pdf][here]].
