* Introduction                                                       :ignore:
/CHECKBOX/ is a simple puzzle platformer I wrote in C++ using SFML as a framework.
It uses Box2D for physics and Dear Imgui for a debug menu (opens with ~F1~).

As a special game mechanic, the checkpoint system in the game is based on a
single box/chest that you can pick up, carry and throw using the ~F~ key. Pressing
~R~ makes your player character respawn from the chest. These respawns are
infinite and so you can use them to your advantage and to solve puzzles.
