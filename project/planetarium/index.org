This is a university project I have worked on in a team for an application that
mimics a planetarium experience. It was developed using an existing 3D OpenGL
engine that supports virtual reality devices. The planetarium was specifically
designed to be ran on the university's VR dome system, where users can select a
planet to visit using a pointer device.
